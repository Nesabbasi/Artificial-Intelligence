## Projects

### CA0 - Introduction to AI

Introduction to AI and Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on predicting the survival of Titanic passengers.

### CA1 - Search

Implementation of search algorithms including BFS, DFS, IDS, A*, and Weighted A*.

### CA2 - Genetics

Equation builder implementation using genetic algorithms.

### CA3 - Game

Implementation of the `Sim` game using the Minimax algorithm, with performance improvements through pruning.

### CA4 - Naive Bayes

Classification of news into five categories using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

### CA5 - Machine Learning

Implementation of classifiers (Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression) to predict diabetes. Random Forest and GridSearchCV for optimal classification.

### CA6 - Neural Networks

#### Phase 1:
Implementation of a neural network from scratch to classify Arabic letters.

#### Phase 2:
Utilization of the `TensorFlow` library and `Keras` API to implement a neural network classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset.
